RTByte is a fully modular multipurpose Discord bot built on the incredible [Klasa](https://klasa.js.org/) framework for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). It brings a ton of features to help you run and manage your server, and is fully integrated into Discord's audit log system.

We aim to provide the most consistent and easy-to-use Discord mod bot solution available, with our key focus areas being modularity, performance, consistency, and choice.

For support, changelogs, and a link to add RTByte to your server, please join our [support Discord](https://discord.gg/eRauWP4).

## Notable features


✅ Easy setup

* Fully automated setup. All channels and necessary roles are created and configured, including channel permissions.

✅ Extensive logging

* Fully configurable logs for your server. Choose what you want included in your server log, and where you want the logs posted.

✅ Server moderation

* Efficient moderation actions that properly log reasons to your server's audit logs (if applicable). All moderation commands obey the role hierarchy, so moderators can't act on other moderators or admins and the like.

✅ Blacklisting

* Server-configurable blacklists that can optionally scan usernames and nicknames, issue automated warnings, mutes, kicks, or bans, as well as delete messages or change nicknames.

✅ Joinable roles

* Allow users to join specified roles on your server. Command can list available roles and how many people have that role.

✅ Custom commands

* Create custom commands for your users with full integration into RTByte's logging system.
